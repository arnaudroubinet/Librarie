## Backend Screenshot (Quarkus 3)

The backend is currently downloading dependencies for the initial startup. Once ready, the Dev UI Extensions page will be available at http://localhost:8080/q/dev-ui/extensions.

## How to Access Screenshots

Since browser screenshots taken by the AI agent during PR development aren't directly accessible in GitHub comments, I'm committing these screenshots to the repository where they can be viewed by:

1. **In the PR Files Changed tab**: Navigate to the `screenshots/` directory
2. **Direct repository access**: Browse to `screenshots/` in the repository
3. **Download the files**: From the repository file view

This provides a permanent, accessible record of the proof-of-operation screenshots required by the coding rules.
