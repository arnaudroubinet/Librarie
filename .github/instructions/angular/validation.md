# Golden Rules (ALWAYS follow)
1. As proof add the duration of build and the state at the end of the commit message
2. Always use `context7` first (MCP) for Angular documentation.
3. Always use `context7` first (MCP) for UI/UX Design design pattern.
4. Always use `angular-cli` MCP server for angular interaction
5. Minimize new dependencies: justify each new library (prefer Quarkus extensions already present); remove unused imports/config.
6. **Frontend Style Guide Compliance**: ALWAYS ensure the `/frontend` directory and Angular project follows the [Angular Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) including naming conventions, file organization, and code structure.
