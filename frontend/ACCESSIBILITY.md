# Accessibility Improvements for MotsPassants

This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

## Critical Accessibility Fixes Implemented

### 1. Skip Link
- **Location**: `src/index.html`
- **Implementation**: Added a skip link that appears on keyboard focus to allow screen reader and keyboard users to bypass navigation and jump directly to main content
- **CSS**: Positioned off-screen by default, visible on focus with high-contrast outline
- **Target**: Links to `#main-content` anchor in the navigation component

### 2. Main Content Landmark
- **Location**: `src/app/components/navigation.component.ts`
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `id="main-content"` to the main element
  - Added `role="main"` and `tabindex="-1"` for programmatic focus
  - Ensures screen readers can identify and navigate to the main content region

### 3. Navigation ARIA Labels
- **Location**: `src/app/components/navigation.component.ts`
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `role="navigation"` and `aria-label="Main navigation"` to nav element
  - Added descriptive `aria-label` attributes to all navigation links
  - Marked decorative icons with `aria-hidden="true"`
  - Added `role="img"` with descriptive labels for functional icons
  - Added proper heading roles for section titles

### 4. Iconify Icon Accessibility
All iconify-icon elements have been updated with proper ARIA attributes:
- Decorative icons: `role="img" aria-hidden="true"`
- Functional icons: `role="img" aria-label="[descriptive label]"`

This ensures screen readers either skip decorative icons or announce functional ones with meaningful context.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Automated Testing with Axe
- **Tool**: @axe-core/playwright
- **Test File**: `tests/accessibility.spec.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - WCAG 2.0 Level A and AA compliance
  - WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA compliance
  - Critical and serious violations detection
  - Color contrast checking
  - Form label associations
  - Heading hierarchy validation
  - Keyboard accessibility
  - ARIA attribute validation

### Test Commands
```bash
npm run test:a11y              # Run accessibility tests headless
npm run test:a11y:headed       # Run with browser visible
npm run test:a11y:report       # View test report
```

## Remaining Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Book Cards**: Add `role="list"` to books grid and `role="listitem"` to individual cards
2. **Loading States**: Add `role="status"` and `aria-live="polite"` to loading indicators
3. **Error Messages**: Add `role="alert"` to error containers for immediate screen reader announcement
4. **Form Labels**: Ensure all form inputs in search component have proper labels or aria-labels
5. **Button Labels**: Add descriptive aria-labels to icon-only buttons (bookmark, share, etc.)

### Medium Priority
1. **Focus Indicators**: Enhance visual focus indicators for better visibility
2. **Search Suggestions**: Add ARIA live regions for search autocomplete
3. **Dynamic Content**: Add aria-live regions for content that updates dynamically (search results, book counts)
4. **Pagination**: Add ARIA labels to pagination controls
5. **Dropdown Menus**: Ensure mat-select components have proper ARIA labels

### Low Priority
1. **Tooltips**: Add tooltips or aria-describedby for actions that might need clarification
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Document keyboard shortcuts and make them discoverable
3. **Motion Reduction**: Respect prefers-reduced-motion for users with motion sensitivity
4. **High Contrast Mode**: Test and optimize for Windows High Contrast mode

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Screen Reader Testing
- [ ] Test with NVDA (Windows)
- [ ] Test with JAWS (Windows)
- [ ] Test with VoiceOver (macOS)
- [ ] Test with Orca (Linux)

### Keyboard Navigation
- [ ] Tab through all interactive elements in logical order
- [ ] Ensure all functionality is accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Test skip link functionality
- [ ] Verify focus indicators are visible
- [ ] Test form submission with Enter key
- [ ] Test modal/dialog interactions

### Color and Contrast
- [ ] Run automated contrast checker
- [ ] Test with browser zoom at 200%
- [ ] Verify UI remains usable in grayscale mode
- [ ] Check visibility in different lighting conditions

### Responsive and Mobile
- [ ] Test with mobile screen readers (TalkBack, VoiceOver)
- [ ] Verify touch targets are at least 44x44px
- [ ] Test with different font sizes

## CI Integration

The accessibility tests have been integrated into the CI pipeline:
- Tests run automatically on pull requests
- Critical and serious violations cause builds to fail
- Test reports are generated as artifacts
- Coverage reports help identify untested areas

## Compliance Status

### Current Compliance Level
- **WCAG 2.1 Level A**: Partial compliance (ongoing work)
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA**: Partial compliance (ongoing work)

### Known Issues
1. Some dynamically generated content may not announce changes to screen readers
2. Color contrast on some secondary UI elements may not meet AA standards
3. Complex components (book reader) require additional accessibility work
4. Form validation messages need ARIA live region announcements

### Next Steps
1. Complete high-priority improvements listed above
2. Conduct comprehensive manual testing with screen readers
3. Address all automated test failures
4. Perform user testing with users who rely on assistive technologies
5. Document accessibility features in user guide
