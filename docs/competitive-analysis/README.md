#### Option A: Full Competition
- **Goal:** Match all competitors
- **Timeline:** 3-5 years
- **Investment:** $5.5M-8M
- **Team:** 10-15 developers
- **Risk:** High (late to market)

#### Option B: Focused Niche ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
- **Goal:** Dominate ebooks + audiobooks
- **Timeline:** 2-3 years
- **Investment:** $3M-5M
- **Team:** 6-10 developers
- **Risk:** Medium (achievable)

#### Option C: Incremental Growth

- **Timeline:** 5-7 years
- **Investment:** $500K-1M per year
- **Team:** 3-5 developers
- **Risk:** Low (sustainable)

The following documents were created based on the V1.0 analysis and need revision:

1. **QUICK_START.md** - References 28 features, needs update to 100+

3. **SUMMARY.md** - Based on old estimates
4. **INDEX.md** - Navigation may need updates
5. **features/** directory:
   - 01-audiobook-support.md
   - 02-mobile-apps.md
   - 03-opds-support.md
   - 04-multi-user-roles.md

These will be updated in subsequent commits to reflect the V2.0 findings.

### What to Trust

**Trust (V2.0):**
- ‚úÖ FEATURE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md

## ü§î Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Why such a big change?

**A:** The initial analysis was based on README-level research. The revision examined complete documentation, wikis, APIs, and user guides for each competitor, revealing 3-4x more features.

### Q: Is the 3-5 year timeline realistic?

**A:** Yes. Competitors have 5-10 years of development. Catching up requires sustained investment and focus. The V1.0 timeline of 18 months was not feasible.

### Q: Can we skip features and go faster?

**A:** Option C (incremental) allows slower pace with less investment. However, Tier 1 features (collections, OPDS, metadata, search, etc.) are essential for market viability.

### Q: What about the V1.0 detailed specs?

**A:** The 4 detailed feature specs (audiobooks, mobile apps, OPDS, multi-user) are still valuable but need revision to reflect:
- More realistic timelines
- Additional related features
- Integration with new findings

### Q: Should we still pursue this?

**A:** That depends on:
- Appetite for 2-5 year commitment
- Budget availability ($3M-8M)
- Team scaling capability (6-15 people)
- Strategic importance to stakeholders

If yes to above: **Option B (Focused Niche) is recommended**  
If uncertain: **Option C (Incremental) is safer**  
If no: **Re-evaluate project viability**
