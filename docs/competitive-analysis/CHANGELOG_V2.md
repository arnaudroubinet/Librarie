## Strategic Impact Changes

### V1.0 Assessment

**Timeline:** 18 months  
**Investment:** $1.5M-2.4M  
**Team:** Peak 9 developers  
**Outcome:** Market leadership in 18 months  
**Feature Coverage Target:** 80%+

### V2.0 Reality Check

**Timeline:** 3-5 years  
**Investment:** $3M-8M  
**Team:** 6-15 developers (strategy dependent)  
**Outcome:** Feature parity possible in 3-5 years  
**Current Coverage:** ~5% (not 70%)

### Why Such a Big Change?

1. **Underestimated Feature Count:** 28 vs 100+ = 3.5x difference
2. **Underestimated Complexity:** Many features require deep integration
3. **Underestimated Competition:** Competitors have 5-10 years of development
4. **Overestimated Current State:** Librarie has basics only
