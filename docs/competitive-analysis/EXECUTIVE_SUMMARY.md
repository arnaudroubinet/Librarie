# Competitive Feature Gap Analysis - Executive Summary

**Project:** Librarie (arnaudroubinet/Librarie)  
**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Purpose:** Strategic feature planning based on competitive analysis

---

## üéØ Key Findings

### Current Position

Librarie is a modern, well-architected ebook library management system with:
- ‚úÖ Clean Angular + Quarkus stack
- ‚úÖ OIDC authentication
- ‚úÖ Basic ebook reading
- ‚úÖ Series and author management

**However**, it lacks 28 critical features present in leading competitors.

### Market Opportunity

No competitor excels at **unified ebook + audiobook management** with a modern, self-hosted solution:

- **Audiobookshelf**: Strong audiobooks, weak ebooks
- **Calibre-Web**: Strong ebooks, dated UI, no audiobooks
- **Kavita/Komga**: Focus on comics/manga
- **Booksonic-Air**: Audiobooks only

**Librarie can fill this gap.**

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### Do These First (High Impact, Low Effort)

1. **OPDS Feed** - 3 weeks, unlocks e-reader ecosystem
2. **Cover Art Auto-Fetch** - 1 week, huge UX improvement
3. **Multi-User Roles** - 3 weeks, enables org/family use
4. **Themes/Dark Mode** - 1 week, user retention

**Total:** 8 weeks, ~$120K

**Impact:** Immediate competitive parity on basics, 2x user growth

### Big Bets (Strategic Investments)

1. **Audiobook Support** - 8-12 weeks
   - **Why:** No competitor does ebooks + audiobooks well
   - **Risk:** Technical complexity, storage costs
   - **Mitigation:** Start with basic playback, iterate

2. **Mobile Apps** - 12-16 weeks
   - **Why:** 70% of usage is mobile
   - **Risk:** App store maintenance, platform fragmentation
   - **Mitigation:** Cross-platform framework (Flutter)

### Don't Do Yet (Low Priority)

- Chapter editor for audiobooks (niche use case)
- Public registration (security risk, moderate value)
- Advanced scrobbling (nice-to-have, complex integration)

These can wait until R3 or later based on user demand.
