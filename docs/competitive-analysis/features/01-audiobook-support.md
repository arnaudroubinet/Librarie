## Architecture

### Data Model

```sql
CREATE TABLE audiobook_metadata (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id UUID REFERENCES books(id),
    format VARCHAR(10),
    duration_ms BIGINT,
    narrator VARCHAR(255),
    chapters JSONB
);

ALTER TABLE books ADD COLUMN media_type VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'EBOOK';
```

### API Endpoints

```
POST /api/v1/audiobooks/upload
GET /api/v1/audiobooks/{id}/stream (with Range support)
GET /api/v1/audiobooks/{id}/metadata
GET /api/v1/audiobooks/{id}/chapters
```

### Key Dependencies
- JAudioTagger (metadata extraction)
- HTML5 Audio API (playback)
- HTTP Range requests (streaming)

## Implementation Tasks

1. Backend Data Model (1 week)
2. Metadata Extraction (1 week)  
3. Streaming Endpoint (1 week)
4. Frontend Player (2 weeks)
5. Integration & Testing (1 week)

## Test Plan

- Unit: Metadata extraction, streaming logic
- Integration: Upload → extract → play flow
- E2E: Full user journey from upload to playback
- Performance: Streaming latency < 500ms
- Security: Authentication, path traversal prevention

## Success Metrics

- 30% user adoption in 3 months
- 95% successful first playback
- <1% error rate
- 60% monthly retention

## Risks

- Large file handling → Use streaming/chunking
- Format compatibility → Standardize on M4B/MP3
- DRM content → Not supported initially
