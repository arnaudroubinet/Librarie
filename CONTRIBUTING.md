## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Backend**: Java 21, Maven 3.9+
- **Frontend**: Node.js 20+, npm 10+
- Git

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arnaudroubinet/Librarie.git
   cd Librarie
   ```

2. **Backend setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Frontend setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm ci
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the coding standards (see below)
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run tests locally**
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend
   mvn test
   
   # Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm test
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. **Push and create a Pull Request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Our project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. All pull requests must pass CI checks before merging.

### Workflows

#### Main CI Pipeline (`ci.yml`)
Runs on every pull request and push to main/develop branches.

**Features:**
- **Change Detection**: Only runs jobs for changed components
- **Backend CI**: Builds and tests Java backend with Maven
- **Frontend CI**: Builds and tests Angular frontend with npm
- **Security Scanning**: Scans dependencies for vulnerabilities using Trivy
- **Status Check**: Final gate that requires all jobs to pass

**Triggered by:**
- Pull requests targeting `main` or `develop`
- Direct pushes to `main` or `develop`

#### CodeQL Analysis (`codeql.yml`)
Performs static code analysis for security vulnerabilities.

**Features:**
- Analyzes Java and JavaScript/TypeScript code
- Detects security vulnerabilities and code quality issues
- Runs on PRs, pushes, and weekly schedule

**Languages analyzed:**
- Java (backend)
- JavaScript/TypeScript (frontend)

#### Backend CI (`backend-ci.yml`)
Dedicated workflow for backend changes.

**Runs:**
- Maven tests with coverage
- Package application
- Upload test results and coverage reports

#### Frontend CI (`frontend-ci.yml`)
Dedicated workflow for frontend changes.

**Runs:**
- Code formatting checks (Prettier)
- Unit tests with Karma/Jasmine
- Build production application
- Upload test results and build artifacts

#### Bundle Size Check (`bundle-size-check.yml`)
Monitors frontend bundle sizes on pull requests.

**Runs:**
- Build and measure bundle sizes
- Compare with main branch
- Post results as PR comment
- Fail if bundles exceed limits

### Required Status Checks

The following checks must pass before a PR can be merged:

1. **Backend CI**: All backend tests and build must succeed
2. **Frontend CI**: All frontend tests and build must succeed  
3. **Security Scan**: No critical or high severity vulnerabilities
4. **CodeQL Analysis**: No security issues detected
5. **CI Status Check**: Final verification that all jobs passed

### Artifacts

CI workflows upload the following artifacts (retained for 7 days):

- **Backend**:
  - Test results (`surefire-reports/`)
  - Code coverage reports (`jacoco/`)
  
- **Frontend**:
  - Test results with coverage
  - Production build artifacts

- **Security**:
  - Trivy vulnerability scan results (SARIF format)

### Local CI Testing

You can run the same checks locally before pushing:

```bash
# Backend
cd backend
mvn clean verify

# Frontend  
cd frontend
npm ci
npx prettier --check "src/**/*.{ts,html,scss,css}"
npm run test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless --code-coverage
npm run build
```

## Coding Standards

### Backend (Java/Quarkus)
- Follow Java coding conventions
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Write Javadoc for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and concise
- Write unit tests for all business logic

### Frontend (Angular/TypeScript)
- Follow Angular style guide
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Format code with Prettier
- Use semantic HTML and proper accessibility attributes
- Write unit tests for components and services

### Git Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits format:
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation changes
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Example: `feat: add book search functionality`

## Testing

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend

# Run unit tests
mvn test

# Run tests with coverage
mvn verify

# Run specific test
mvn test -Dtest=YourTestClass
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend

# Run tests once
npm run test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test -- --watch=false --browsers=ChromeHeadless --code-coverage
```

## Bundle Size Monitoring

We monitor bundle sizes to ensure the application remains performant and fast to load.

### Checking Bundle Size Locally

Before submitting a pull request, you can check the bundle size:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
npm run size
```

The `size-limit` tool will report:
- Current size of the bundle
- Whether the size exceeds configured limits
- Loading time estimates on slow networks
- Running time estimates on slower devices

### Bundle Size Limits

Current limit is configured in `frontend/package.json` under the `size-limit` section:

- **Application Bundle**: 500 kB (compressed size of all files loaded on initial page load)

This limit includes the main application code, polyfills, Angular Material components, and all other code that loads when the application first opens. Lazy-loaded routes and components are not included in this measurement.

### What Happens in CI

When you submit a pull request affecting the frontend:

1. The GitHub Actions workflow builds your branch
2. Bundle sizes are checked against configured limits
3. Sizes are compared with the main branch
4. A comment is posted to your PR with the results
5. **The PR build will fail if any bundle exceeds its limit**

### If Your Bundle Exceeds the Limit

If the bundle size check fails, you have several options:

1. **Optimize your code** (preferred):
   - Remove unnecessary imports
   - Use lazy loading for routes and components
   - Tree-shake unused code
   - Optimize dependencies

2. **Analyze the bundle** to identify large dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   npm run analyze
   ```

3. **Update size limits** (only if justified):
   - If the size increase is necessary and justified
   - Update the limits in `frontend/package.json`
   - Document the reason in your PR description

### Bundle Analysis

To analyze what's in your bundle:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run analyze
```

This will:
1. Build your application with stats generation
2. Create a `dist/frontend/stats.json` file
3. Display a link to the esbuild analyzer

Open https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/ in your browser and upload the generated `dist/frontend/stats.json` file to see:
- Size of each module
- What's taking up space in your bundles
- Dependencies and their sizes
- Opportunities for optimization

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create PR**
   - Use a descriptive title
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Link related issues

2. **CI Checks**
   - All CI workflows must pass
   - Address any failing tests or security issues
   - Ensure code coverage doesn't decrease significantly
   - Bundle sizes must not exceed limits

3. **Code Review**
   - Request reviews from maintainers
   - Address review comments
   - Update PR as needed

4. **Merge Requirements**
   - âœ… All CI status checks passing
   - âœ… At least one approved review
   - âœ… No merge conflicts
   - âœ… Branch is up to date with target branch

5. **Merge Strategy**
   - Squash and merge for feature branches
   - Keep commit history clean

## Security

### Reporting Vulnerabilities
If you discover a security vulnerability, please email the maintainers directly instead of opening a public issue.

### Dependency Updates
- Dependencies are scanned automatically by Trivy
- Security updates should be prioritized
- Test thoroughly after updating dependencies

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing, please:
- Check existing documentation
- Search closed issues
- Open a new issue with your question
